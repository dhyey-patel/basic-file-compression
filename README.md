# Basic File Compression

This is a program written in java to simply compress small text files and then decompress them. It was done as an assignment so the specifications of the compression and decompression are given by the professor, and were not arbitrarily chosen.

The various text files are used to test the code, the .txt extension is the original, .zzz is the compressed and .dec is the decompressed file
